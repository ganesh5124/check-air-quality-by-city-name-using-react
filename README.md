# Project `aqi-react`
Air Quality check is a project created to know the Air Quality Index of various cities of the world. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to create the frond-end User Interfaces using ReactJs. At the backend, [Air Quality Programmatic APIs](https://aqicn.org/api/) are used to get the details of the Air Quality.

# What is Air Quality Index(AQI)
An air quality index (AQI) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.  // by reference of google

Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards. More details can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index).
